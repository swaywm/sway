sway-output(5)

# NAME

sway-output - output configuration commands for sway

# DESCRIPTION

You may combine output commands into one, like so:

	output HDMI-A-1 mode 1920x1080 pos 1920 0 bg ~/wallpaper.png stretch

You can get a list of output names with *swaymsg -t get_outputs*. You may also
match any output by using the output name "\*". Additionally, "-" can be used
to match the focused output by name and "--" can be used to match the focused
output by its identifier.

Some outputs may have different names when disconnecting and reconnecting. To
identify these, the name can be substituted for a string consisting of the make,
model and serial which you can get from *swaymsg -t get_outputs*. Each value
must be separated by one space. For example:

	output "Some Company ABC123 0x00000000" pos 1920 0

# COMMANDS

*output* <name> mode|resolution|res [--custom] <WIDTHxHEIGHT>[@<RATE>Hz]
	Configures the specified output to use the given mode. Modes are a
	combination of width and height (in pixels) and a refresh rate that your
	display can be configured to use. For a list of available modes for each
	output, use *swaymsg -t get_outputs*.

	To set a custom mode not listed in the list of available modes, use
	*--custom*. You should probably only use this if you know what you're
	doing.

	Examples:

		output HDMI-A-1 mode 1920x1080

		output HDMI-A-1 mode 1920x1080@60Hz

*output* <name> modeline <clock> <hdisplay> <hsync_start> <hsync_end> <htotal> <vdisplay> <vsync_start> <vsync_end> <vtotal> <hsync> <vsync>
	Configures the specified output to use the given modeline. It can be
	generated using *cvt*(1) and *gtf*(1) commands. See *xorg.conf*(5).
	Only supported on DRM backend.

	Example:

		output HDMI-A-1 modeline 173.00 1920 2048 2248 2576 1080 1083 1088 1120 -hsync +vsync


*output* <name> position|pos <X> <Y>
	Places the specified output at the specific position in the global
	coordinate space. The cursor may only be moved between immediately
	adjacent outputs. If scaling is active, it has to be considered when
	positioning. For example, if the scaling factor for the left output is
	2, the relative position for the right output has to be divided by 2.
	The reference point is the top left corner so if you want the bottoms
	aligned this has to be considered as well.

	Example:

		output HDMI1 scale 2

		output HDMI1 pos 0 1020 res 3200x1800

		output eDP1 pos 1600 0 res 1920x1080

	Note that the left x-pos of eDP1 is 1600 = 3200/2 and the bottom y-pos is
	1020 + (1800 / 2) = 1920 = 0 + 1920

*output* <name> scale <factor>
	Scales the specified output by the specified scale _factor_. An integer is
	recommended, but fractional values are also supported. If a fractional
	value are specified, be warned that it is not possible to faithfully
	represent the contents of your windows - they will be rendered at the next
	highest integer scale factor and downscaled. You may be better served by
	setting an integer scale factor and adjusting the font size of your
	applications to taste. HiDPI isn't supported with Xwayland clients (windows
	will blur).

*output* <name> scale_filter linear|nearest|smart
	Indicates how to scale application buffers that are rendered at a scale
	lower than the output's configured scale, such as lo-dpi applications on
	hi-dpi screens. Linear is smoother and blurrier, nearest (also known as
	nearest neighbor) is sharper and blockier. Setting "smart" will apply
	nearest scaling when the output has an integer scale factor, otherwise
	linear. The default is "smart".

*output* <name> subpixel rgb|bgr|vrgb|vbgr|none
	Manually sets the subpixel hinting for the specified output. This value is
	usually auto-detected, but some displays may misreport their subpixel
	geometry. Using the correct subpixel hinting allows for sharper text.
	Incorrect values will result in blurrier text. When changing this via
	*swaymsg*, some applications may need to be restarted to use the new value.

*output* <name> background|bg <file> <mode> [<fallback_color>]
	Sets the wallpaper for the given output to the specified file, using the
	given scaling mode (one of "stretch", "fill", "fit", "center", "tile"). If
	the specified file cannot be accessed or if the image does not fill the entire
	output, a fallback color may be provided to cover the rest of the output.
	_fallback_color_ should be specified as _#RRGGBB_. Alpha is not supported.

*output* <name> background|bg <color> solid_color
	Sets the background of the given output to the specified color. _color_
	should be specified as _#RRGGBB_. Alpha is not supported.

*output* <name> transform <transform> [clockwise|anticlockwise]
	Sets the background transform to the given value. Can be one of "90", "180",
	"270" for rotation; or "flipped", "flipped-90", "flipped-180", "flipped-270"
	to apply a rotation and flip, or "normal" to apply no transform. The
	rotation is performed clockwise. If a single output is chosen and a
	rotation direction is specified (_clockwise_ or _anticlockwise_) then the
	transform is added or subtracted from the current transform (this cannot be
	used directly in the configuration file).

*output* <name> disable|enable
	Enables or disables the specified output (all outputs are enabled by
	default).

*output* <name> toggle
	Toggle the specified output.

*output* <name> dpms on|off|toggle
	Enables or disables the specified output via DPMS. To turn an output off
	(ie. blank the screen but keep workspaces as-is), one can set DPMS to off.

*output* <name> max_render_time off|<msec>
	Controls when sway composites the output, as a positive number of
	milliseconds before the next display refresh. A smaller number leads to
	fresher composited frames and lower perceived input latency, but if set too
	low, sway may not finish compositing in time for display refresh, leading to
	delayed frames.

	When set to off, sway composites immediately after display refresh,
	maximizing time available for compositing.

	To adjust when applications are instructed to render, see *max_render_time*
	in *sway*(5).

	To set this up for optimal latency:
	. Launch some _full-screen_ application that renders continuously, like
	  *glxgears*.
	. Start with *max_render_time 1*. Increment by *1* if you see frame
	  drops.

	This setting only has an effect on Wayland and DRM backends, as support for
	presentation timestamps and predicted output refresh rate is required.

*output* <name> adaptive_sync on|off
	Enables or disables adaptive synchronization (often referred to as Variable
	Refresh Rate, or by the vendor-specific names FreeSync/G-Sync).

	Adaptive sync allows clients to submit frames a little too late without
	having to wait a whole refresh period to display it on screen. Enabling
	adaptive sync can improve latency, but can cause flickering on some
	hardware.

*output* <name> render_bit_depth 8|10
	Controls the color channel bit depth at which frames are rendered; the
	default is currently 8 bits per channel.

	Setting higher values will not have an effect if hardware and software lack
	support for such bit depths. Successfully increasing the render bit depth
	will not necessarily increase the bit depth of the frames sent to a display.
	An increased render bit depth may provide smoother rendering of gradients,
	and screenshots which can more precisely store the colors of programs
	which display high bit depth colors.

	Warnings: this can break screenshot/screencast programs which have not been
	updated to work with different bit depths. This command is experimental,
	and may be removed or changed in the future.
