/**
 * The relay structure manages the relationship between text-input and
 * input_method interfaces on a given seat. Multiple text-input interfaces may
 * be bound to a relay, but at most one will be focused (reveiving events) at
 * a time. At most one input-method interface may be bound to the seat. The
 * relay manages life cycle of both sides. When both sides are present and
 * focused, the relay passes messages between them.
 *
 * Text input focus is a subset of keyboard focus - if the text-input is
 * in the focused state, wl_keyboard sent an enter as well. However, having
 * wl_keyboard focused doesn't mean that text-input will be focused.
