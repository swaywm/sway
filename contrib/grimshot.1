.SH SYNOPSIS
.P
Grimshot is an easy to use screenshot tool for sway. It relies on grim, slurp
and jq to do the heavy lifting, and mostly provides an easy to use interface.
.P
A recommended usage pattern is to just bind this to Super+P via sway:
.P
.nf
.RS 4
# Screenshots:

bindsym Mod4+Shift+p exec grimshot region
