## Installation

### From Packages

Sway is available in many distributions. Try installing the "sway" package for
yours. If it's not available, check out [this wiki page](https://github.com/swaywm/sway/wiki/Unsupported-packages)
for information on installation for your distributions.

If you're interested in packaging sway for your distribution, stop by the IRC
channel or shoot an email to sir@cmpwn.com for advice.

### Compiling from Source

Install dependencies:

* meson \*
* [wlroots](https://github.com/swaywm/wlroots)
* wayland
* wayland-protocols \*
* pcre
* json-c
* pango
* cairo
* gdk-pixbuf2 \*\*
* [scdoc](https://git.sr.ht/~sircmpwn/scdoc) >= 1.8.0 (optional: man pages) \*
* git \*

_\*Compile-time dep_

_\*\*optional: required for swaybg_

Run these commands:

    meson build
    ninja -C build
    sudo ninja -C build install

On systems without logind, you need to suid the sway binary:

    sudo chmod a+s /usr/local/bin/sway

Sway will drop root permissions shortly after startup.

## Configuration

If you already use i3, then copy your i3 config to `~/.config/sway/config` and
it'll work out of the box. Otherwise, copy the sample configuration file to
`~/.config/sway/config`. It is usually located at `/etc/sway/config`.
Run `man 5 sway` for information on the configuration.

## Running

Run `sway` from a TTY. Some display managers may work but are not supported by
sway (gdm is known to work fairly well).
