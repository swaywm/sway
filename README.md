## Release Signatures

Releases are signed with [E88F5E48] and published [on GitHub][GitHub releases].

## Installation

### From Packages

Sway is available in many distributions. Try installing the "sway" package for
yours.

### Compiling from Source

Check out [this wiki page][Development setup] if you want to build the HEAD of
sway and wlroots for testing or development.

Install dependencies:

* meson \*
* [wlroots]
* wayland
* wayland-protocols \*
* pcre2
* json-c
* pango
* cairo
* gdk-pixbuf2 (optional: system tray)
* [scdoc] (optional: man pages) \*
* git (optional: version info) \*

_\* Compile-time dep_

Run these commands:

    meson build/
    ninja -C build/
    sudo ninja -C build/ install

On systems without logind nor seatd, you need to suid the sway binary:

    sudo chmod a+s /usr/local/bin/sway

Sway will drop root permissions shortly after startup.

## Configuration

If you already use i3, then copy your i3 config to `~/.config/sway/config` and
it'll work out of the box. Otherwise, copy the sample configuration file to
`~/.config/sway/config`. It is usually located at `/etc/sway/config`.
Run `man 5 sway` for information on the configuration.

## Running

Run `sway` from a TTY. Some display managers may work but are not supported by
sway (gdm is known to work fairly well).
