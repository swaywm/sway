  <interface name="ext_action_binder_v1" version="1">
    <description summary="action binder">
      This interface is designed to allow any application to bind
      an action.

      An action is an arbitrary couple of a namespace and a name describing the
      wanted behaviour. These two strings are not meant to be user-visible.
      Some namespaces are well-known and shared by applications while each
      application can have its own namespaces for internal actions.
      It is possible to have the same action in several namespaces, e.g. to
      allow application-specific bindings in addition to global actions.

      It is left to the compositor to determine which client will get events.
      The choice can be based on policy, heuristic, user configuration, or any
      other mechanism that may be relevant.
      Here are some examples of dispatching choice: all applications, last
      focused, user-defined preference order, latest fullscreened application.

      This interface is exposed as global

        The trigger is a suggestion to the compositor, and the action should not rely
        to being set to that specific trigger.
        The client does not know which trigger was actually set, but when a binding is
        bound, it recieves from the compositor a human readable string describing the trigger,
        if any, so it could show it in a ui.

        After calling bind, either the "bound" or "rejected" event is sent.
        Subsequent calls to bind should be ignored.

        This event may be sent after a binding was bound, should the compositor

        Depending on the user configuration, an action can be either one-off or
