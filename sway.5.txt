sway - configuration file and commands

Description
-----------

A sway configuration file is a list of sway commands that are exected by sway on
startup. These commands usually consist of setting your preferences and setting
key bindings. An example config is likely present in /etc/sway/config for you to
check out.

All of these commands may be issued at runtime through **sway-msg**(1).

Commands
--------

**bindsym** <key combo> <command>::
	Binds _key combo_ to execute _command_ when pressed. You may use XKB key names
	here (**xev**(1) is a good tool for discovering them). An example bindsym
	command would be _bindsym Mod1+Shift+f exec firefox_, which would execute
	Firefox if the alt, shift, and F keys are pressed together. Any valid sway
	command is eligible to be bound to a key combo.

**exec** <shell command>::
	Executes _shell command_ with sh.

**exec_always** <shell command>::
	Like exec, but the shell command will be executed _again_ after *reload* or
	*restart* is executed.

**exit**::
	Exit sway and end your Wayland session.

**floating** toggle::
	Toggles the "floating" status of the focused view.

**focus** <direction>::
	Direction may be one of _up_, _down_, _left_, _right_, or _parent_. The
	directional focus commands will move the focus in that direction. The parent
	focus command will change the focus to the parent of the currently focused
	container, which is useful, for example, to open a sibling of the parent
	container, or to move the entire container around.

**focus_follows_mouse** <yes|no>::
	If set to _yes_, the currently focused view will change as you move your
	mouse around the screen to the view that ends up underneath your mouse.

**kill**::
	Closes the currently focused view.

**layout** <mode>::
	Sets the layout mode of the focused container. _mode_ can be one of _splith_,
	_splitv_, or _toggle split_.

**reload**::
	Reloads the sway config file without restarting sway.

**set** <name> <value>::
	Creates a substitution for _value_ that can be used with $_name_ in other
	commands.

**split** <vertical|horizontal>::
	Splits the current container, vertically or horiziontally. The letters "h" and
	"v" can be used instead of the full words "vertical" or "horizontal".

**splith**::
	Equivalent to **split horizontal**.

**splitv**::
	Equivalent to **split vertical**.

**floating_modifier** <modifier>::
	When the _modifier_ key is held down, you may use left click to drag floating
	windows, and right click to resize them.

**fullscreen**::
	Toggles fullscreen status for the focused view.

**gaps** <amount>**::
	Adds _amount_ pixels between each view, and around each output.

**gaps** <inner|outer> <amount>**::
	Adds _amount_ pixels as an _inner_ or _outer_ gap, where the former affects
	spacing between views and the latter affects the space around each output.

**workspace** <name>::
	Switches to the specified workspace.

**workspace** <prev_on_output|next_on_output>::
	Switches to the next workspace on the current output.

**workspace** <name> output <output>::
	Specifies that the workspace named _name_ should appear on the specified
	_output_.
